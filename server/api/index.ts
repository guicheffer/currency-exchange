/**
 * ðŸ™ƒ WTFCK* IS THIS?
 *
 * TL;DR;
 * This is basically a proxy api for generate random numbers (close to the daily rates)
 * coming from the choosen API for currency rates.
 *
 * Full explanation:
 *
 * Yes, I apoligize for keeping almost everything belonging to the "custom" api in this file.
 * That's because I wanted to be fast plus the fact I was too lazy since this part of the task wasn't very needed.
 *
 * At the end of the day, this will emulate the idea of bringing different values every second.
 *
 * I'll leave here for ease, this should NEVER be done in a real world system.
 * Haha, once again, sorry for that! :(
